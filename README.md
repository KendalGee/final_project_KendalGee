# Tackling Online Harassment: Text Analysis of Social Media Platform Policies

## Abstract
Online harassment is a pervasive issue affecting millions of people globally. According to a survey by Pew Research Center, 4 in 10 Americans have experienced some form of online abuse, and the severity of such abuse appears to be increasing. This has raised concerns about how social media companies are responding and protecting users. 

To shed light on this issue, this research project uses text analysis techniques of lexical density analysis, word frequency analysis and TF-IDF to analyze the Community Guidelines documents of three of the largest social media platforms (YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok) in order to better understand how they characterize and respond to online harassment. Specifically, this project seeks to answer the following questions:

1. What are the motivations that platforms have to issue public policies on harassment? 
2. Are the policies transparent on the characterization of harassment?
3. Do the policies prioritize taking action against misconduct or is the language vague? 

Rerding motivation the findings of this study suggests that Facebook and Twitter have more comprehensive policies on harassment compared to YouTube. The TF-IDF analysis also shows that Facebook places greater emphasis on the issue of harassment than HYouTube and TikTok. The findings also indicate that Facebook's policy emphasizes taking action against harassment by content removal and providing resources to users while TikTok focuses on action primarily against sexual harassment and compliance with law enforcement requets. YouTube's policy focuses on encouraging users to report harassment and supporting victims but the results indicate that the burden of action is placed on the user rather than action by the platform. None of the platforms had extensive description of actions preventing harassment.  acFinally, more comprehensive analysis is needed to understand the characterization of harassment and the nuances of the differing aproaches by each platform. 

By exploring these questions, the goal of this research is to inform public policy by shedding light on the breadth of approaches taken by social media companies in addressing online harassment so that future research can be conducted on the effectiveness of differing responses.
